# Summary
`ZodiPy` is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for zodiacal light simulations. 
Its purpose is to provide the astrophysics and cosmology communities with an 
accessible and easy-to-use Python interface to existing zodiacal light models, 
assisting in the analysis of astrophysical data and enabling quick and easy 
zodiacal light forecasting for future experiments. `ZodiPy` implements the 
[@Kelsall1998] and the [@Planck2014] interplanetary dust models, which allows for
zodiacal light simulations between $1.25-240\mu$m and $30-857$GHz, respectively, 
with the possibility to extrapolate the models to other frequencies. 

# Statement of need
Zodiacal light is the main source of diffuse radiation observed in the infrared 
sky between $1-100\mu$m. The light is the result of scattering and re-emission of 
sunlight by dust grains in the interplanetary medium. Zodiacal light is one of the 
most challenging foregrounds to model in cosmological studies of the Extragalactic 
Background Light (EBL) in the infrared sky, primarily due to its seasonal nature. 

Traditionally, observers of the infrared sky have had to build their own zodiacal 
light tools (see the
[LAMBDA foreground models page](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/foreground/fg_models.html) 
for a list of existing tools). However, these programs are either 
only usable for the specific experiments for which the tool was made, or unaccessible 
as they require the use of licensed programing languages or unpractical web 
interfaces. Much of modern astronomy and cosmology is done in Python due to the wide 
range of available high quality tools and open source projects and communities, such as 
the Astropy project [@astropy]. The lack of a general purpose zodiacal light tool 
in this space was the main motivation behind the development of the `ZodiPy` package.

When using `ZodiPy`, the user is required to provide the following data: 

1) A set of observations, in either ecliptic or galactic coordinates, in the form of 
angular sky coordinates or as HEALPIx [@Gorski2005] pixel indices.
2) A center frequency or a bandpass.
3) The time of observation. 
4) The heliocentric position of the observer, although this may be omitted if the 
observer is located at the position of a major solar system object, such as on Earth 
or at the Sun-Earth-Moon barycenter L2. In this case the position is queried directly 
through the `astropy.coordinates` solar system ephemeridis. 

This information is then used to evaluate a sequence of line-of-sight integrals through 
a three-dimensional model of the interplanetary dust distribution. For more details 
about the implementation and the models used we refer to the following paper on `ZodiPy`
[@San2022].

`ZodiPy` has been used by several research projects[@2023arXiv230617219A; 
@2023arXiv230617226R; @Tsumura2023; @Avitan2023; @Hanzawa2024] with applications ranging from assistance in determining the observational fields of the coming NASA Roman Space Telescope, to model data obtained aboard the Hayabusa2 JAXA satellite.
